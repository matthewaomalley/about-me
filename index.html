<h2><mark>Introduction</mark></h2>
<p>I am a junior Computer Science student (with a concentration in Secure Programming)
    at Lewis University. <br> I grew up and currently reside in Lemont, IL. with my sister and
    two parents. I have an affinity and fascination <br> for technology, love to play the 
    acoustic guitar, & occassionally build wooden furniture as a hobby.
</p>

<h2><mark>What I hope to Learn</mark></h2>
<p>I aspire to take my programming abilities to the next level with this course. Building
    from <br>concepts learned from previous classes such as Object-Oriented Programming, I 
    want to <br>further my knowlegdge of programming logic and technique to be proficient in
    development.<br> This will strengthen my foundation and make a better-rounded computer scientist.
</p>

<h2><mark>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</mark></h2>
<p>As stated above, I love to build wooden furniture. Typically, I like to combine
    technology with <br>projects to serve modern functionality but have a timeless appearance.
    Last summer, I built <br>a wooden end table with a built-in, recessed wireless charger for
    compatible devices. From <br>the beginning of the process by sketching/planning to the end
    with staining and finishing, <br>I find it peaceful and rewarding.
</p>
<h2><mark>Fun Fact</mark></h2>
<p>A fun fact about me is that I got my first job when I was 15 and had various different <br>
    jobs that I worked until I began my Junior year at Lewis University.
